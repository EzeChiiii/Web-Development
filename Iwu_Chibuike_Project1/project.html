                        <p>At present time, statistics show that credit card fraud  is higher than it's ever been. 
                            It is said that credit card fraud is expected over the next decade to exceed over 430 billion
                             dollars in losses globally. Systems have been designed to combat the fraud efforts however 
                             businesses are only 54% confident in detecting actual legitimate fraud. This project that I’m 
                             presenting to my audience comes from a credit card fraud detection dataset.
                              The main problem is that the algorithm performs unsuccessfully in terms of accuracy.

                            In today’s time people buy new homes to raise their families for a better life.
                             Before a person plans on buying a home they would analyze the features that 
                             the home comes with it. These features do indeed have a huge role in the sales price in 
                             purchasing a home.The dataset that we will be analyzing and conducting tests on is the House Prices- Advanced Regression Techniques</p>

                        <p>This project that I’m conducting is about the origin of basketball and player statistics in the NBA.
                             This shows how basketball has evolved over the past 100 years. Basketball has evolved to where any player can apply different skill sets
                               and improve their ability to play the game. Players aren’t limited to play a certain position 
                               because of their expansion of new skills to dominate the new game of basketball.
                                Players are used to having an effect on the game by what they provide in a game. </p>

                        <p>In today’s day in age countries all over the world are going through transitions with their own regimes. 
                            The United States, China and several countries across the world have experienced their share of economic crises like the 
                            Great Depression. Countries that have been suffering the most are the African countries due to 
                            corruption which causes inflation and other factors. The country that catches my attention the most 
                            is Nigeria because I am from there. The problem here that I want to solve is what factors
                             lead to the decline in the Nigerian economy.</p>

                        <p>This is my Soccer Database using MySQL. In my project I created a table where I can choose players 
                            from a fantasy draft and add them to my team depending on my team's budget and the price of the player.
                             Also, you can search players from their country or club that they are playing for in real life.
